## What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
The purpose of the breakpoint is to stop the code from running particular point. you place a marker by clicking it before the line of code after the line number.  


## Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No, the program will only run until it reaches the breakpoint.

## How do we debug the next line of code?

We use step over, when we use this it brings us to the next line. If something is wrong ie in a for loop, at the start of the for loop it goes to the end and not running something inbetween allowing you to see that something isnt working.

## What does the step into command do?
allows us to switch us into a method and pause at the top of the method.  

## What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

evaluate expression only deals with one expression where as evaluate code fragment you can evaluate multiple expressions ie an entire function/temporary variables.
